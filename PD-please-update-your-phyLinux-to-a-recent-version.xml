	This is a notification for an API change in phyLinux when displaying the available
	release Manifests. We switched the manifest filename to be named after the uid
	release name. This leads to no entry being visible for old phyLinux version in the
	switched branches.
	Please update phyLinux to a recent Version:
	$ wget https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
	$ chmod +x phyLinux
	$ ./phyLinux init
-->
