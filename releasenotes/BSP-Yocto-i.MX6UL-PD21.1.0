Notes:
------
- With this release, PHYTEC introduces a new release/test system based on continuous
integration. Due to still beeing in development and the conversion to the new
system still going on, this BSP has not been tested for it's full functionality
yet. Untested features may not work correctly or stable. For a list of tested
functions, please visit the PHYTEC release webpage:
https://www.phytec.de/phyline/
- This image and its supported features have been tested to fulfill productive
use for quality requirements and therefore can be used in productive systems. In
case, this release is missing a feature which you require, please consider
using an earlier release, for example PD19.1.x, until Q1/Q2 2021 when our
new release/test system has matured to full featured releases.
- From PD19.1.X to PD21.1.0 the Linux kernel introduced a set of changes in
device tree for the i.MX 6UL. Since bootloader and kernel both access
this devicetree updating from an early release to PD21.1.0 requires a
bootloader update. Othwerwise the Kernel's devicetree would require a rework.
- Until now the BSP Manual showed examples for partitioning the ubi Layer on
the NAND flash with 8 MB for the Kernel image. With PD21.1.0 the kernel size
exceeds these 8 MB so a larger kernel partition is required. In the BSP
manual we now suggest a kernel partition size of 16 MB.
- With PD21.1.0 we start to use config fragments for our kernel builds. So
instead of running 'make imx_v6_v7_defconfig' to configure a manual kernel
build now the command 'scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m
arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig arch/arm/configs/imx6_phytec_* &&
./build olddefconfig' needs to be used.
