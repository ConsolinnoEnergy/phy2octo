Changes since PD19.1.1:
-----------------------
- Fixes:
  * General:
    - Optimized system Stability at low Temperatures. (System crashes could
      sometimes be observed at Temperatures below -30°C)

Known Issues:
-------------
- general:
* When booting from MMC sometimes (about 5 in 1000) barebox and kernel
fail to attach the NAND device with following error message:
gpmi_reset_block(f0a2a000): module reset timeout

- kernel:
* Audio recording with the TLV320 is not working.
* ADC provides uncalibrated values.
* rtc1 (SNVS rtc) has low accuracy.
* Suspend feature is untested.

Notes:
------
- The driver needed for PEB-WLBT-05 is not built-in per default. To add the
required driver to the build, see BSP-documentation.
- To increase the overall system stability, the initial voltage level of the ARM
SOC has been increased by 75 mV from 1.175 V to 1.25 V. This change fixes
sporadic unstable behavior on low Temperatures (below -30°C).
