Build Environment:
------------------
- Ubuntu 20.04 64Bit


Known Issues:
-------------
- kernel:
  * Low performance drop on IO-operations with external devices when
    LOW-POWER-IDLE state is active (CONFIG_CPUIDLE)

Notes:
------
- PHYTEC introduced a new release/test system based on continuous integration.
  Builds and already implemented tests for the actual kernel LTS and yocto states
  can be found at the PHYTEC-website.
- The cpuidle LOW-POWER-IDLE state has been disabled by default in favor of
  performance. For a manual on how to enable/disable cpuidle states from SYSFS,
  please refer to the BSP manual.
- From PD19.1.X to PD21.X the Linux kernel introduced a set of changes in
  device tree for the i.MX 6UL. Since bootloader and kernel both are using this
  devicetree, updating from an early release to PD21.X requires a bootloader
  update. Otherwise the Kernel devicetree would require a rework.
- With PD21.1.0: We start to use config fragments for our kernel builds. So
  instead of running 'make imx_v6_v7_defconfig' to configure a manual kernel
  build now the command 'scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m
  arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig arch/arm/configs/imx6_phytec_* &&
  ./build olddefconfig' needs to be used.
- With PD21.2.0 we start to use ported IMX PXP driver. Testing revealed that the
  overall performance is better than mainline PXP driver. Using and testing IMX PXP
  driver can be done with gst-imx plugins. Switching back to the mainline driver can
  be achieved through disabling "pxp_imx" node and enabling "pxp" node in the
  device-tree.
- With PD21.2.0: RAUC systems make use of a new partitioning layout including a
  "config" partition. This partition can store persistent program configuration
  data which has to remain untouched across updates of the root filesystem. It
  is recommended to adapt this layout only for new devices. Existing devices
  already operating in the field may have to re-setup their flash layout in
  order to incorporate this change, if the default layout is being used.
- With PD21.2.1: For systems using RAUC, a new distro got introduced named "ampliphy-rauc". Images
  using that distro are meant to be used only on eMMC or NAND flash. SD cards are
  not supported by "ampliphy-rauc". For detailed information about setting up a system
  using RAUC, please refer to the "RAUC Update & Device Management Manual".
- With PD21.2.1: For systems using Security, a distro got introduced named "ampliphy-secure" with
  the image "phytec-security-image". The distro and image is configured with RAUC,
  Secure Boot, Secure Key Storage (TPM, NXP CAAM), Secure Storage (integrity, encrypted)
  and Access Control support. For detailed information about setting up a system
  using Security, please refer to the "Security Manual".
- With PD21.2.1: For systems using Security or RAUC, a distro got introduced named
  "ampliphy-provisioning" with the image "phytec-provisioning-image".
  The distro and image is configured for installing a image with  RAUC and Security
  support from sd-card to emmc and for configuration of Security features on the board.
