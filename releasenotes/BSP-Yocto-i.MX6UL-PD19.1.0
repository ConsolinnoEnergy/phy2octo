  * Update from v4.12.4 to v4.14.93
  * Tag: v4.14.93-phy3
- barebox v2019.01.0
  * Tag: v2019.01.0-phy3
- Yocto 2.5.3 (sumo)
- Qt 5.10.1 from meta-qt5 (sumo)

Tested Yocto Images:
--------------------
- phytec-qt5demo-image on:
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-2
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-4
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-5
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-6
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-7

- phytec-headless-image on:
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-3

Build Environment:
------------------
- Ubuntu 16.04 64Bit

Changes since PD17.2.0:
-----------------------
- New Features:
  * Support for i.MX 6ULL Y2 528 MHz / 792 MHz / 900 MHz
    (phyboard-segin-imx6ul-6)
  * Support for i.MX 6UL G2 696 MHz
  * Support for eMMC (phyboard-segin-imx6ul-7)
  * barebox: USB host and OTG support
  * barebox: DFU file transfer is now supported
  * RAUC (Robust Auto-Update Controller)
    - Only implemented for NAND flash (RAUC with eMMC does not work out of the
      box)
    - barebox scripts for partitioning and flashing of the NAND flash
    - RAUC update tool in userspace
    - Yocto support for building rauc bundles
  * Following phyCAM cameras are now supported with this BSP:
    - VM-009
    - VM-010
    - VM-011
  * Switching the external DVFS voltage is now supported to reduce
    power consumption
  * Add basic SPI support

- Fixes:
  * kernel:
	- RS485 half duplex mode is now working as expected


Known Issues:
-------------
- general:
  * When booting from MMC sometimes (about 5 in 1000) barebox and kernel
    fail to attach the NAND device with following error message:
    gpmi_reset_block(f0a2a000): module reset timeout

- kernel:
  * Audio recording with the TLV320 is not working.
  * ADC provides uncalibrated values.
  * rtc1 (SNVS rtc) has low accuracy.
  * Suspend feature is untested.


Notes:
------
- ubiformat in the barebox does not show 100% message when finished in certain
  cases although it finished successful. This is caused by a change in
  implementation which is not harmful. The successful completion of ubiformat
  can always be checked by analyzing the return code.
- The device tree naming changed in comparison to the PD17.2.0 release:
  * Removed the word phyboard
  * Added a ff (full featured) or lc (low cost) tag
  * Added the primary boot media (nand/emmc)
- Using tftp in user space is very slow. This is partly caused by improper
  coalesce settings for tftp. So the preformance can be improved a little by
  issuing:
  target$ ethtool -C eth0 rx-usecs 1 tx-usecs 1 rx-frames 1 tx-frames 1
  But be aware that this will increase the interrupt load of the eth0 interface.
