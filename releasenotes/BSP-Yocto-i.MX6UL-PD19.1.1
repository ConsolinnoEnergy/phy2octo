  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-6
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-7
  * phyboard-segin-imx6ul-8

Build Environment:
------------------
- Ubuntu 18.04 64Bit

Changes since PD19.1.0:
-----------------------
- New Features:
  * Support for i.MX 6UL G2 with eMMC (phyboard-segin-imx6ul-8)
  * Support for PEB-WLBT-05 with Sterling LWB Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (See notes)

- Fixes:
  * barebox:
    - Disable UBI wear-leveling in barebox to prevent possible stack overflows.
    - Fixes multiple minor NAND/UBI issues.
    - Fix bad block handling in bad block table (BBT) area.


Known Issues:
-------------
- general:
  * When booting from MMC sometimes (about 5 in 1000) barebox and kernel
    fail to attach the NAND device with following error message:
    gpmi_reset_block(f0a2a000): module reset timeout

- kernel:
  * Audio recording with the TLV320 is not working.
  * ADC provides uncalibrated values.
  * rtc1 (SNVS rtc) has low accuracy.
  * Suspend feature is untested.


Notes:
------
- ubiformat in the barebox does not show 100% message when finished in certain
  cases although it finished successful. This is caused by a change in
  implementation which is not harmful. The successful completion of ubiformat
  can always be checked by analyzing the return code.
- The device tree naming changed in comparison to the PD17.2.0 release:
  * Removed the word phyboard
  * Added a ff (full featured) or lc (low cost) tag
  * Added the primary boot media (nand/emmc)
- Using tftp in user space is very slow. This is partly caused by improper
  coalesce settings for tftp. So the preformance can be improved a little by
  issuing:
  target$ ethtool -C eth0 rx-usecs 1 tx-usecs 1 rx-frames 1 tx-frames 1
  But be aware that this will increase the interrupt load of the eth0 interface.
- The driver needed for PEB-WLBT-05 is not built-in per default. To add
  driver to the build, the feature option for this has to be uncommented in the
  conf/local.conf from the build directory and rebuild again.
