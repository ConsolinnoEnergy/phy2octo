    LOW-POWER-IDLE state is active (CONFIG_CPUIDLE)

Notes:
------
- PHYTEC introduced a new release/test system based on continuous integration.
  Builds and already implemented tests for the actual kernel LTS and yocto states
  can be found at the PHYTEC-website.
- From PD19.1.X to PD21.X the Linux kernel introduced a set of changes in
  device tree for the i.MX 6UL. Since bootloader and kernel both are using this
  devicetree, updating from an early release to PD21.X requires a bootloader
  update. Otherwise the Kernel devicetree would require a rework.
- With PD21.2.0 we start to use ported IMX PXP driver. Testing revealed that the
  overall performance is better than mainline PXP driver. Using and testing IMX PXP
  driver can be done with gst-imx plugins. Switching back to the mainline driver can
  be achieved through disabling "pxp_imx" node and enabling "pxp" node in the
  device-tree.
- The cpuidle LOW-POWER-IDLE state has been disabled by default in favor of
  performance. For a manual on how to enable/disable cpuidle states from SYSFS,
  please refer to the BSP manual.
- With PD21.1.0 we start to use config fragments for our kernel builds. So
  instead of running 'make imx_v6_v7_defconfig' to configure a manual kernel
  build now the command 'scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m
  arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig arch/arm/configs/imx6_phytec_* &&
  ./build olddefconfig' needs to be used.
- For systems using RAUC, a new distro got introduced named "ampliphy-rauc". Images
  using that distro are meant to be used only on eMMC or NAND flash. SD cards are
  not supported by "ampliphy-rauc". For detailed information about setting up a system
  using RAUC, please refer to the "RAUC Update & Device Management Manual".
- For systems using Security, a distro got introduced named "ampliphy-secure" with
  the image "phytec-security-image". The distro and image is configured with RAUC,
  Secure Boot, Secure Key Storage (TPM, NXP CAAM), Secure Storage (integrity, encrypted)
  and Access Control support. For detailed information about setting up a system
  using Security, please refer to the "Security Manual".
