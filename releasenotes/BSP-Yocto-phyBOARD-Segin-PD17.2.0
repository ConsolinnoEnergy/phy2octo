	* MMC support (barebox/kernel)
	* Audio support (Line IN/OUT, Speaker) (kernel)
	* Support for RTC (kernel) 
	* ADC support (kernel)


Known Issues/Limitations:
-------------------------
- The 696 MHz operating point of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL is not supported.
- The DVFS pin to switch VDD_ARM_SOC from 1.4 V to 1.3 V on phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/6ULL is already included in the device tree but not yet supported in the kernel. But DVFS with internal LDOs is already supported.
- When booting from MMC sometimes (about 5 in 1000) barebox and kernel fail to attach the NAND devices.
- ADC provides uncalibrated values.
- Booting the root filesystem over NFS is not possible.
- tftp in kernel is slow, but UDP in general is not affected.
- Multimedia page is removed from QT5 Demo.
- QT5 Demo is only working correctly on the 7" displays, smaller displays need adaptation.
- Starting and stopping the QT5 demo influences the consoleblank parameter.
- When returning from suspend to ram (mem or standby) the display might not work correctly.
- Suspend to ram (freeze) does not work correctly.
- RS485 is only working correctly in raw mode (stty -F /dev/ttymxc4 raw echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke).
- The TiwiBLE chip sometimes requests a restart of the firmware which leads to a backtrace dump. The connection is reastablished afterwards and transfers continued.
- Yocto: When a host JDK is present perf fails to build with:
  ERROR: perf-1.0-r9 do_package_qa: QA Issue: -dev package contains non-symlink .so:...
  To fix this issue, update to the latest meta-phytec morty stable branch
   $ cd sources/meta-phytec
   $ git remote update
   $ git checkout git.phytec/morty
- Yocto: Build fails on new Linux Distros with several different Errors. To fix the issues
  update Poky to the latest stable version
   $ cd sources/poky
   $ git remote update
   $ git checkout yocto/morty
