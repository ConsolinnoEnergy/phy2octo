        * Support for RTC (kernel) 
        * ADC support (kernel)


Known Issues/Limitations:
-------------------------
- When booting from MMC sometimes (about 5 in 1000) barebox and kernel fail to attach the NAND devices.
- ADC provides uncalibrated values
- Booting the root filesystem over NFS is not possible
- Following displays are not supported with the NXP vendor kernel:
        * AC101 (3,5" capacitive)
        * AC102 (4,3" capacitive)
        * AC103 (5,7" capacitive)
- Multimedia page is removed from QT5 Demo
- The TiwiBLE chip sometimes requests a restart of the firmware which leads to a backtrace dump. The connection is reastablished afterwards and transfers continued.
